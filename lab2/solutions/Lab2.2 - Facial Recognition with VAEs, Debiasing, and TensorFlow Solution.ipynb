As defined in the generative modeling lecture, we'll use the term *latent space* to refer to the probability distributions of the aforementioned latent variables. Putting these ideas together, we consider a classifier *biased* if its classification decision changes after it sees some additional latent features.

The model then uses this information to mitigate unwanted biases by sampling faces with rare features, like dark skin or hats, *more frequently* during training.
